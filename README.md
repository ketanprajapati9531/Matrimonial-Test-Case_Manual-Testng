SaptaVidhi: Revolutionizing Matrimonial Matchmaking

SaptaVidhi is a comprehensive matrimonial platform available as both a mobile application developed in Flutter and a web application built with React. The app and web versions offer identical features, differing only in their design aesthetics.

Key Features:

Profile Creation: Users are prompted to fill out detailed personal information, including family background and partner preferences. This information is crucial for the matchmaking process.

Gender-Specific Profiles: Depending on the user's gender selection (male or female), the platform displays profiles accordingly. For example, male users will only see female profiles, and vice versa.

Matching Algorithms: Advanced matching algorithms analyze user-provided information and preferences to suggest compatible matches. This ensures that users are presented with profiles that align with their criteria.

Chat: Once connections are established, users can engage in private chats with their matches.
Email: Users can communicate via email with their matches, facilitating communication beyond the app.
Upgrade Feature: SaptaVidhi offers a premium upgrade option, granting users exclusive access to communication features. With the paid upgrade, users gain the ability to initiate conversations with any profile through both email and chat functionalities. This feature is not available to standard users.
